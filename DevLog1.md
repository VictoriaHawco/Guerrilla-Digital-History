# DevLog 1
#### Stardate October 1-8 2019
This week I think I finally settled on a project, and have begun the prep work in earnest, meaning I've set up a project in GitHub and built a to-do list! I'm tentatively titling the project Contested Histories: Parliament Hill. The essential thrust behind the project is reminiscent of the Uncoformatble Tours project we looked at: to complicate art and the political meanings inherent in it.

To do this, I plan on utilizing either Echoes or ARIS to create either a basic audio guide revealing the complicated histories behind the statuary on Parliament Hill, or to present alternative options that reflect different aspects of Canadian History.
Briefly, the form of these Dev-Logs will contain three components: the To-Do List, Project Updates if there are any, and Conclusions, if there are any.

## The To-Do List
- I plan on dividing my work for this project into two basic forms always: the written/theoretical work, and the practical work
- The main aspect of my To-Do List, and what I plan on accomplishing this week, is to dive into Echoes and ARIS and tour around those two programs to see what they are and aren't capable of in terms of my project. Noodling around on these two softwares will take up the bulk of my practical work for the forseeable future.
- Secondly, I plan on compiling a list of the statuary on the Hill and researching their history and thinking/writing on what they represent.
  - The next step for this will to settle on an approach: either to produce some sort of text/audio guide revealing the complicated nature of the Hill's statuary, or to begin researching alternatives that present a different history for the Hill. Settling on an approach will have to happen before I take next steps for the practical component of this project.
  
  
  ## Conclusion(s)
  I have a lot of work to do, but other than noodling around in ARIS and Echoes, what I really need to do is the prep work re: research on the Hill, it's statuary, and the political history surrounding it.
